# ObjectDetection

This is a simple object detection program using OpenCV and Python. It uses the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect objects.

I built this program to learn how to use OpenCV and Python. I used the following tutorial to help me build this program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfNvhPx5Px8

This project taught me how to use OpenCV and Python. I learned how to use the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect objects. I also learned how to use the webcam to capture images.

The program is very simple and only detects objects in the webcam. I plan to add more features to this program in the future.
